This is the rough draft of the website wireframing: 
1. On the left side will be the logo. 2. Near the logo, there will be Learn Bengali tab. When a user clicks on it, there will be information about our Bengali alphabet, history of Bengali letters, and culture.
3. The home tab will be the first landing page. 
4. About tab will be little be more about our Amar Bangla and there will be an introduction to all our directors with their pictures. 
5. The membership tab will discuss our membership information. How much the membership cost (Single, family, etc). 
6. You will see the introductory writing about Amar Bangla that we stand on (Our Belief and Mission) 
7. Picture of Manitoba (will be about Manitoba).
 8. Update of our Upcoming Event 
9. Contact tab â€“ If the user clicks, they will land in a page where we will have our email to contact and fill up information. 
10. In terms of background coloring, It will be a nice coloring including the tab. 


Learn Bengali : When you will click that tab from the upper left near the LOGo tab,  you will have following info: a NEW PAGE WOLL OPEN . I am writing what should be there. Give me two days.
